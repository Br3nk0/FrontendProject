    "Beschrijving":"The Datapoint 2200 was a mass-produced programmable terminal, designed by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC). This so-called programmable terminal was equipped to perform any task a simple computer could, and exploited this fact by using their 2200s as standalone computer systems. The Datapoint 2200 had a built-in full-travel keyboard, a built-in 12-line, 80-column green screen monitor, and two 47 character-per-inch cassette tape drives each with 130 kB capacity." ,

It ran on the BASIC Plus language, with five user-accessible ROM cartridge slots and the ability to print documents using the HP 9866 printer, which seamlessly sat on top of the machine. HP 9830s were commonly employed at aerospace companies such as Boeing.

However it was expensive and, unlike modern personal computers, not based on a microprocessor. It was developed at Xerox PARC and released on March 1, 1973. It was the first computer to use a desktop metaphor first commercialized on the later Xerox Star, and one of the first with a mouse-driven graphical user interface (GUI) and several other innovations in user interfaces of the time. It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, other Xerox facilities, and at several universities for many years." ,

The PS/2 line was created by IBM in an attempt to recapture control of the PC market by introducing an advanced yet proprietary architecture. IBM's considerable market presence plus the reliability of the PS/2 ensured that the systems would sell in relatively large numbers, especially to large businesses. However the other major manufacturers balked at IBM's licensing terms to develop and sell compatible hardware, particularly as the demanded royalties were on a per machine basis." ,

Released on September 20, 1989, it was received with excitement from most critics but consumer sales were quite low. It featured a fast, sharp, and expensive black and white active matrix LCD screen in a hinged design that covered the keyboard when the machine was not in use. The Portable was one of the early consumer laptops to employ an active matrix panel, and only the most expensive of the initial Powerbook line, the Powerbook 170, used one, due to the high cost. The cursor pointing function was handled by a built-in trackball that could be removed and located on either side of the keyboard. It used expensive SRAM in an effort to maximize battery life and to provide an instant on low power sleep mode. The machine was designed to be high-performance, at the cost of price and weight." ,
